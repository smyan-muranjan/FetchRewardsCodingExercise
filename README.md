# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise

This repository contains my solution to the Fetch Rewards Android coding exercise. The app is built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** and follows the **MVVM** architecture. The app fetches and displays data in a list, grouping and sorting items appropriately.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: The app is structured using the MVVM pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and making the codebase maintainable.
- **Jetpack Compose**: The UI is entirely built using Jetpack Compose, Android's modern UI toolkit, which allows for more expressive and concise UI code.
- **Network Integration**: The app fetches data using Ktor and displays it in a user-friendly format.
- **Custom UI Design**: The app uses a Material Design and a custom color scheme defined in `colors.xml`, which tries to replicate the Fetch Rewards colors.
